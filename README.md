# Twig Ticket App

A simple ticket management app built with PHP and Twig. Create, view, edit, and delete tickets. This README is intentionally short and focused — quick setup and usage so you can get started fast.

## Live Demo
(If you host a demo, add the URL here)

## Features
- Create new tickets with title and description
- View a list of tickets
- Edit and delete tickets
- Server-rendered UI using Twig templates
- Simple file- or database-backed storage (adjust in configuration)

## Tech
- PHP (7.4+ recommended)
- Twig (templating)
- Composer for dependency management
- Optional: SQLite/MySQL for persistence

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaimzh/Twig-Ticket-App.git
cd Twig-Ticket-App
```

2. Install PHP dependencies
```bash
composer install
```

3. Configure (if applicable)
- Copy any example env/config files, e.g.:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
- Edit .env or config to set database or storage preferences.

4. Run the app (built-in PHP server)
```bash
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
```
Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

(If your project uses a framework, replace the run step with the framework's usual dev server command.)
